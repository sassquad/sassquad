### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Stephen Scott, and I work as a front end developer at [The Berkeley Group](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk). 

Over the last 20 years, I've worked in various aspects of digital media with or for clients as diverse as:

- UK Home Office
- University of Surrey
- CITY AM
- Disney
- HMV
- Yehudi Menuhin School
- Prudential
- Nutricia Pharmaceuticals
- TennisTV.com
- Ryman
- The Conran Shop 
- Guildford School of Acting

My Github is primarily a place where I have various retrogames written for the BBC Microcomputer way back in the 1990s. However, I remastered one of these games in 2021. I hope to remaster my others, and maybe create new ones in the future. The tooling available on modern computers make retrocoding much more of a joy than it used to be.

I'm fairly active on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/sassquad), but have made the [odd blogpost](https://sascott.blogspot.com/) on retrogaming, accessibility or data journalism.

For more information, please visit my [website](https://www.sassquad.net/).
